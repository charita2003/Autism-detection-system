        <h2>About Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h2>
        <p>
            Autism is a neurological developmental and behavioral disorder impacting communication and social interaction skills. 
            Many show very restricted interest bordering on obsession and repetitive behavior known as stereotype behavior. 
            The most visible signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to appear between the ages of 2 to 3 years though in some cases, 
            it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. However, the timing and severity of autism’s first symptoms vary widely.
        </p>
        <p>
            The symptoms range from mild to severe and have now been grouped under “autism spectrum disorder (ASD)” by DSM-5. 
            The word “spectrum” has been added to denote the wide gamut of symptoms it encompasses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Autism Spectrum Disorder along with Asperger’s syndrome, Childhood Disintegration disorder, 
            Pervasive Developmental Delay (not otherwise specified) are commonly known as Pervasive Developmental Disorder and Rett’s syndrome.
